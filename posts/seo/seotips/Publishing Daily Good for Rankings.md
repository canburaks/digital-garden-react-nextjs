# Publishing Daily Good For Rankings?
This is the question that was asked:

> “Does posting one content daily increase ranking?”

It’s unclear who at Google answered the question.
This is the answer that was given from Google:

>“No.
>Posting daily or at any specific frequency for that matter doesn’t help with ranking better in Google search results.
>However, the more pages you have in the Google index, the more your content may show up in search results.”
